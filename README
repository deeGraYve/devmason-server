Pony Server.

A basic Django implementation of the backend server for Pony Build.

It implements a very naive and basic model structure at the moment, using XML RPC. This should eventually be a drop in replcement for pony-build's own key value store.

It loses some of the flexibility, and it feels like Results needs to be more dynamic somehow. Maybe a good use case for a Key Value store.
